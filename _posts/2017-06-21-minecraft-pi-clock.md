With just a glance, I know the time, just like a clock in an item frame.

# What it displays

* sun/moon's position
* moon's phase (the brighter the more full)
* sky color, changes during sunrise and sunset


# How it works

* Python module running on the Minecraft server
  * watches level.dat file for changes
  * parses level.dat for server time
  * publishes time to AWS IoT using MQTT

* Python module running on the Raspberry Pi
  * subscribes to the servertime MQTT topic
  * updates the display when it receives a new time from AWS IoT

No mods, in fact, this works on snapshots
